"""
Test Cases
==========

Test cases for evaluating the Data Agent.

Each test case includes:
- question: The natural language question
- expected_values: Strings that should appear in the response
- category: For filtering (basic, aggregation, data_quality, complex, edge_case)
- difficulty: easy, medium, hard
- tags: For more granular filtering

The test cases are designed to verify:
1. Basic query functionality
2. Aggregation and grouping
3. Data quality handling (the F1 dataset has intentional type mismatches)
4. Complex multi-table queries
5. Edge cases and error handling
